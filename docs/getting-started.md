subtitle: What Amber is and when to reach for it.

# Getting Started

Amber builds data-driven interfaces from configuration. You describe a form's fields or a list's
columns in YAML, bind a model, and the widget renders working markup with AJAX behavior — sorting,
pagination, searching, validation, uploads — wired up automatically.

It is the same widget engine that powers the [October CMS](https://octobercms.com) admin panel,
packaged as a standalone library for any Laravel application. There is no CMS dependency, no
JavaScript framework and no build step: the browser assets are plain CSS and ES modules, styled on
top of Bootstrap 5.

## The sixty second version

Define the columns:

```yaml
# resources/amber/user/columns.yaml
columns:
    name:
        label: Name
        searchable: true
    email:
        label: Email Address
    created_at:
        label: Created
        type: datetime
```

Build the widget in a controller and render it in a view:

```php
$widget = Lists::make([
    'alias' => 'list',
    'model' => new User,
    'columns' => '~/resources/amber/user/columns.yaml',
    'recordsPerPage' => 10,
]);
```

```blade
{!! $widget->render() !!}
```

That renders a sortable, searchable, paginated table of users. Forms work the same way from a
`fields.yaml`, and filters from a `scopes.yaml`.

## The widgets

- **[Form](forms.md)** — data-editing forms with field types, tabs and contexts
- **[Lists](lists.md)** — record tables with column types, sorting and pagination, plus a tree and
  reorderable variant
- **[Filters](filters.md)** — scope-based filtering that constrains a list query
- **[Toolbar](toolbar.md)** — action buttons and a search bar above a list
- **[UI Elements](ui.md)** — buttons, inputs and callouts via the `Ui` facade

Widgets compose: a typical index page is a Toolbar (buttons + search), a Filter, and a List all bound
to the same model, refreshing each other through AJAX.

## How it fits together

Every widget is a [Larajax](https://larajax.org) view component. Building a widget with `::make()`
inside a controller action binds it to that controller, which is what routes its AJAX handlers —
see [AJAX & Larajax](ajax.md) for the lifecycle.

Configuration is declarative but never a cage: every widget can also be configured with plain PHP
arrays, extended by subclassing, and driven by any model — including plain Eloquent models, see
[Using Eloquent models](eloquent.md).
